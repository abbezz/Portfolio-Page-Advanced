# Getting Started

# Project Title - Portfolio-Page-Advanced



## How it Works
 User Story AS A customer, I WANT to search for nearby restaurants/takeaways and access a map, SO THAT I can pick which restaurant to go to based on my current location.

 GIVEN I am a customer, WHEN I search for a specific restaurant name, THEN a list of restaurant/takeaway names, address, opening times, customer ratings and a phone number   appear.
 
 WHEN I am not sure which restaurant to search for, I want to click pre-filtered buttons which give me a list of places to choose from.

 IF I want to go to the location, then I will have access to a map which will give me the fastest route to get there.
