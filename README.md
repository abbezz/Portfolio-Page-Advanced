# Getting Started

# Project Title - ACHA Foods!

The purpose of our business is to list details of close-by restaurants/takeaways,  using the customers current location and google maps.
The customer is able to search for any restaurant/take-away name and the application will pick up their current location and list nearby restaurants.  
The application includes information about the restaurant/take away and includes a map picking up current location and provide a route. 
It also has an about us, contact us and social media page. 


## How it Works
 User Story AS A customer, I WANT to search for nearby restaurants/takeaways and access a map, SO THAT I can pick which restaurant to go to based on my current location.

 GIVEN I am a customer, WHEN I search for a specific restaurant name, THEN a list of restaurant/takeaway names, address, opening times, customer ratings and a phone number   appear.
 
 WHEN I am not sure which restaurant to search for, I want to click pre-filtered buttons which give me a list of places to choose from.

 IF I want to go to the location, then I will have access to a map which will give me the fastest route to get there.

## Lessons Learned

# What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
Presenting this project was a huge challenge for me. I could not help my nervousness and lack of confidance while presenting my work in a room full of people. my shyness may have taken over the best of me and i may have lost a few words inbetween but i managed to try pull myself together with the help of my team which im grateful to and finish it off well. I intend to progress and work on myself more in terms of presentation and communication. i will be challenging myself in the future to do better and be well confident in speaking infront of an audiance.

Workinng in a team was a completely new experience for me. I learnt that with team work every individual will have different ideas to present and share so for us collecting all the ideas in one we managed to create an incredible project. I learnt how to set up Goole Map API as this was my role in the project it toke great time but with loads of reasearches and reading and trying different ways as well as ideas with help of my team i managed to complete the task I also created the footer of our website which was all a success. I enjoyed this experiance and bringing this project together with my team was great work, it was a pleasure working with my colleagues. my goal is to improve my team work skills and make progress in my career in the future.
